# Robot Control System (Java OOP)

A grid-based robot control simulation built with object-oriented design.  
The system supports movement commands, battery management, charging stations, movement tracking, and basic environment scanning.

## Features
- 10x10 grid movement (up / down / left / right)
- Battery consumption per move + recharge at charging stations
- Movement history tracking (view / update / reset)
- Basic environment scan around the robot
- OOP design with inheritance (Robot → IntelligentRobot)

## Tech Stack
- Java
- OOP (inheritance, abstraction, encapsulation)
- CLI-based interface

## How to Run
Run the program starting from:
- `RobotControlSystem.java` (contains the main menu)

## What I Practiced
- Modeling a small system with classes and state (position, battery, history)
- Designing modular components (robot logic vs movement tracker)
- Writing clean, structured Java code for a console application
